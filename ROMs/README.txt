- 79589-023.bin. An 8Kb M27128AF1 EPROM. It had a label "79589-032 376 SNAV1.00 201C E86F". On the PCB it's Z36.
- 79590-023.bin. A 16Kb M2764A F1 EPROM. It had a label "79690-023 376SNA V1.00 201C 7224". On the PCB it's Z37.
- chargen.bin is a TMS2732AGL-25 4Kb EPROM. It had a label "79573-001 V1.00 376/8 CHAR. GEN.". On the PCB it's designator isn't visible but I believe it's Z6.
