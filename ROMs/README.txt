combined.bin is the two ROMs containing the firmware combined as they are laid out in memory.

combined.txt is the disassembly with a small number of notes added from the reverse engineering process.

Note: The chargen ROM which contains the character data is corrupt. The dumping process must have gone wrong but you can make out most characters.
